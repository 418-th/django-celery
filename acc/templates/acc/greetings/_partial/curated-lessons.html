        <p>Your curator is not just a regular teacher. He is the Yoda of ELK methodology.
            He speaks your native language, will guide you through the whole course, will help you with grammar,
            will make sure you are ready for classes with native speakers, and will coordinate your materials
            and homework.
        </p>
        <p>Based on your plans your curator will make an individual program for you.
            If you are going to London you will practice with Stef, getting used to a British accent.
            If you are a businessman you will be talking to Adam who owns a small company.
            If you have an artistic nature, Shawn, a poet from Brooklyn, New York will help you with your classes.
        </p>
        <p>You choose a curator during a first lesson.</p>
